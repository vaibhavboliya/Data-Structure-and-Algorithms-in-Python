# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-in-Python

## Objective

There are plenty of resources when it comes to Data Structure and Algorithms implementation for python on the internet. But most of them are not orgainzed or not follow the same pattern and it becomes really hard for someone who wants to learn Data Structure and Algorithms in python, But doesnot find one complete good resource.That prompted me to create this project to create a complete resource for Data Structure and algorithms Implementation in Python for anyone who wants to learn.

Currently this repository is in development more content and resources ll be added continuously.

Feel free to contribute but please follow the Contributing Guidelines to maintain the uniformity of the implementation of data structures and algorithms in python.

## Structure of the repository

This repository contains folders for different data structure and algorithms where you ll find explanation and also the implementation in python.

### Data Structures
